# 👋 Hi, I'm Thomas

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm an aspiring bioinformatics professional with 5 years of wet-lab experience, having previously developed several high-throughput molecular assays to support the promise of gene therapy. I'm interested in developing my software toolkit and building projects that deliver data-driven insights for biological problems.

This page hosts links to some of my classwork, personal projects, and ways to connect.
